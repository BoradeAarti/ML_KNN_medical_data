# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on Medical Data (Cancer Dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** on **medical data (cancer dataset)** to classify and predict cancerous cases based on patient attributes.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- KNN classification for cancer prediction
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimized accuracy
- Performance evaluation using accuracy

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains medical records related to cancer, including:
- Tumor Type
- Cell shape and texture
- Other relevant medical attributes
